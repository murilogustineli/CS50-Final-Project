Instructions for running 'Football Draft' Program

1. Go to my Github page https://github.com/murilogustineli/CS50-Final-Project and download all the files to your desktop. 

2. For this program you will need Anaconda and XAMPP Apache installed to your computer

		https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
	2. You can install XAMPP following this link

3. Anaconda comes with an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code called Jupyter Noebook. We will be using Jupyter Notebook to run our program. Load the following files that you previously downloaded from step 1 into Jupyter Notebook (in the same directory):
	1. MIS Project - Football Draft Main Program.ipynb

	1. Go to your browser, type "localhost" into the address bar and press enter. It will direct you to the XAMPP Apache Website.
	2. Go to phpMyAdmin on the right upper corner and you will be able to see your database created.

5. Run 'Create Football Draft.ipynb' on Jupyter Notebook as this will create a database of sample user information.
